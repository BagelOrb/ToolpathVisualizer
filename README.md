# ToolpathVisualizer
A simple tool to visualize and generate gcode for variable width single layer toolpaths. Used for testing.

This tool was used in testing [libArachne](https://github.com/Ultimaker/libarachne) and [Variable width contouring](https://github.com/mfx-inria/Variable-width-contouring).
Both these libraries were used to produce files describing the locations and widths of extrusion paths for one single layer of a 3D print.
